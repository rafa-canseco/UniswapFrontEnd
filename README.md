# UniswapClone

This project is a clone of Uniswap fully integrated with the UniswapV3 contracts on the Sepolia network. It connects to MetaMask in the browser to facilitate transactions. The interface allows for swapping ERC20 tokens for Ethereum (ETH), trading between different ERC20 tokens, and wrapping and unwrapping ETH. Transactions may fail due to low liquidity in the pools.

## Installation

To install dependencies and run the project, use the following commands:

```bun install``` 
```bun run start```
